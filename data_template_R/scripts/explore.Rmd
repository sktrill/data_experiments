## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
# define the loadData() function
source("load.R")
# define the cleanData() function
source("clean.R")

# load the raw data
time_use_orig <- loadData("../data/atus_00002.csv.gz")
# clean the data
time_use <- cleanData(time_use_orig)



# convert the missing values to NAs
time_use <- convertMissing(time_use)
# check out the summary
summary(time_use)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(time_use) + geom_histogram(aes(x = hours_usually_worked))


# re-run the renameColumns() function
time_use <- renameColumns(time_use_orig)
# convert missing values to NA
time_use <- convertMissing(time_use)
# re-make the histogram
ggplot(time_use) + geom_histogram(aes(x = hours_usually_worked))


ggplot(time_use) + geom_histogram(aes(x = time_spent_personal_care))

# run the convertClass() function
time_use <- convertClass(time_use)
# compare the original variables with the meaningful versions
head(time_use)


library(tidyverse)
source("R/load.R")
source("R/clean.R")

# load the data
time_use_orig <- loadData()
# clean the data
time_use <- cleanData(time_use_orig)
```




include = FALSE prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.
echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.
message = FALSE prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.
warning = FALSE prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.
fig.cap = "..." adds a caption to graphical results.


Use inline code like 'r cars' to do something.

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(mtcars, caption = "a table")
```
